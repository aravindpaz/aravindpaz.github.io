								<b><font size="+1">A new evolutionary phase of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A</font></b><br>
								<br>
								SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the closest observed (~50 kpc) supernova in the last 400 years, providing a unique opportunity for an unprecedented, 
								detailed study of a core-collapse supernova with regular monitoring across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Chandra X-ray Observatory (Chandra) provides 
								an unrivaled opportunity of spatially-resolved spectroscopy in X-rays to directly study the formation and evolution of the remnant of SN 1987A. X-ray emission
								from SN 1987A has been dominated by the SN forward shock interaction with the equatorial ring, which is the dense circumstellar material produced by interactions 
								of the stellar winds from the massive progenitor star during its late stages of stellar evolution before the SN explosion.<br>
								<br>
								I have been the main workforce of the Chandra study of SN 1987A for the past five years as part of my Ph.D. thesis. I revealed that the evolution of the X-ray 
								remnant of SN 1987A has transitioned into a new stage, in which the SN blast wave has passed the ER and is now entering the low-density red supergiant wind beyond 
								the ER. Utilizing several deep (170 – 350 ks) high resolution Chandra grating spectra taken over 14 yr, I showed that, while the ratio of EM between soft (0.5 - 2.0 keV) 
								and hard (3.0 - 8.0 keV) component best-fit spectral models of X-ray emission had been constant between 2004 and 2011, in 2018, it has undergone a significant change (Figure below). Such a 
								“hardening” of the X-ray emission is evidence for increasing contributions from shocked gas having significantly lower densities than that of the ER.

								<b><font size="+1">Evolution of SN 2021krf: Late-time Luminosity and Dust formation</font></b><br>
								<br>
								Core-Collapse supernovae (CCSNe) such as Type Ib/c and II are believed to be powered by radioactive decay of <sup>56</sup>Ni and its decay product <sup>56</sup>Co. For a typical Type Ib/c SN, 
								the late-time luminosity is expected to follow the decay of <sup>56</sup>Co.  A slower decline would suggest the presence of additional power sources such as the 
								central engine and/or strong shock interaction with dense ambient circumstellar material. CCSNe are also interesting laboratories to identify dust formation as the ejecta expands. SN 2021krf 
								is a nearby Type Ic SN (z ~ 0.01 at the distance of 65 Mpc), detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 2021 April 30 (MJD 59334). <br>
								<br>
								In the optical/IR photometric data of SN 2021krf, I found a slow decay of light curves in late-time epochs (days ~ 70 - 300), clearly indicating the presence of powering sources 
								in addition to the radioactive decay of Ni/Co (Figure below). I also noted a clear rising NIR continuum above 2 microns as early as day 68, suggesting the presence of warm dust. 
								In out work, I identified a central neutron star as the additional power source candidate causing the late-time luminosity in SN 2021krf. I also showed that the rising continuum 
								could be explained by early dust formation in SN ejecta. Both these results are extremely unusual for Type Ic SN, which provides a rare, but important sample for the study of the 
								nature of Type Ic SN and its dust formation. This work is currently under peer review and you can read more about our work  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00205">here</a> <br>
