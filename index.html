								സ്വാഗതം, Welcome, सवागत हैं , Bienvenidos! I am Aravind. I am an early-career Astronomer, interested in studying cataclysmic stellar explosions and what they tell us about how we got here! I am from Kerala, India, a lush green state ofted dubbed, "God's Own Country." Outside of science, I love Carnatic Music, dabbling in some sketching / art, being outside, and a good cup of tea. As always, this site is under perennial construction!
